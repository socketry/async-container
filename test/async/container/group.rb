	# - A container spawns children with `restart: true` and `health_check_timeout: N`
	# - health_check! calls @running.each_value { |fiber| fiber.resume(:health_check!) }
	# - A resumed fiber detects health check failure and kills the child
	# - The spawn fiber's while loop continues (restart: true) and calls wait_for with a new child
	# - wait_for tries to add to @running while health_check! is still iterating
	# - This used to cause: RuntimeError: can't add a new key into hash during iteration
